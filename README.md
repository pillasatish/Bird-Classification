# Bird Classification

In the project, we are using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to accurately classify Birds species. Two convolutional neural networks with varied architecture and/or depth, as well as data pre-processing methods, are examined in the project to see how they affect classification performance of bird species. The models used are CNN architecture VGG16Net and ResNet101V2. 

***
The project has been written in Python and consists in a Jupyter notebook(google colab) containing both the source code and the project documentation.

Dataset: http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/stephen.mcgough/Teaching/birds.zip

The main Python libraries used to design the source code are scikit-learn, scikit-image, Keras and tensorflow. 

**CODE**
The Bird_Classification_B21047209_SATISH_PILLA.IPNYB file contains the source code for the entire project. For line of the code there is clear instruction of why were are running the particular code block.

**Report**
Bird_classfication_B210472095_SATISH_PILLA.pdf is the overall report of the project. The report is organized as follows:

1 Introduction	

2 Model Hyperparameters

3 Results
